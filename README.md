# Prayer Times App

Simple Prayer Times App built with Flutter. Using the [https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api] API.
## Project Description

This app was built as a way to test my knoweldge with APIs, JSON parsing, and Flutter in general. It is a simple app that displays prayer times for a given location.
The app only works for Cairo, Egypt at the moment, but it can be easily extended to support other locations by using the Aladhan API.
In addition, when forking this repo, all that is needed is to change the city and country parameters in the api call to change to the speciifc city and country desired.
